## Lean MVP Strategy

### Core Philosophy

**Maximize CanTicket reuse (90%), minimize new development (10%)**

### What's REUSED from CanTicket (No/Minimal Cost):

✅ Authentication & Role-Based Access Control
✅ Time Tracking (clock in/out, timesheets, approvals)
✅ Leave Management (requests, approvals, balance tracking)
✅ Staff Scheduling with **AI Scheduling** (already built)
✅ Alert & Notification System (email + in-app)
✅ Reporting Engine (time reports, staff reports, export)
✅ Dashboards (Admin, Manager, Staff views)
✅ User Management
✅ Calendar Integration
✅ Profile Management

### What's NEW for Buses (Development Focus):

🔨 **End-of-Day Safety Checklists** (2-3 weeks)

- Digital checklist forms
- Tyre condition check
- Fuel level logging
- "Kids left on bus" safety verification
- Photo uploads for vehicle condition
- Manager review and approval workflow

🔨 **Minimal Vehicle Database** (3-5 days)

- Basic vehicle registry (Bus ID, Registration, Status)
- Vehicle selection for shift/checklist
- Simple CRUD interface

🔨 **Branding & Terminology Updates** (2-3 days)

- Update UI labels (Project → Shift, Client → Vehicle, etc.)
- Bus-specific terminology throughout
- Custom dashboard widgets

---

## Feature Breakdown

### **Admin Access** (CanTicket Standard)

- Approve/override leave and timesheets
- Review all safety checklists
- System configuration

### **Manager Access** (CanTicket Standard)

- View and manage assigned teams
- Approve timesheets and leave requests

---

## End-of-Day Safety Checklist (Core New Feature)

### Checklist Flow:

1. **Driver clocks in** → System assigns vehicle/bus
2. **During shift** → Normal time tracking
3. **Before clocking out** → **MANDATORY CHECKLIST**

- Tyre condition (Front/Rear - Good/Fair/Poor)
- Fuel level (% or liters remaining)
- Interior check: "Kids left on bus?" (Yes/No with alert)
- Exterior condition: Photo upload
- Notes field for any issues

4. **Manager review** → Approve or flag for follow-up
5. **Reports** → Checklist completion tracking

### Safety Logic:

- ❌ **Cannot clock out until checklist is completed**
- 🚨 If "Kids left" = Yes → Immediate alert to manager
- 📸 Photo uploads stored securely (Dreamscape storage)
- 📊 Checklist history for compliance audits

---
